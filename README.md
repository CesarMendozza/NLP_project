Growing up, like most kids, I played middle school soccer for a pretty decent team. I can distinctively remember a quote 
by my middle school coach “When Americans stop playing soccer and start playing futbol, thats when America will compete 
with the rest of the world” this is the  quote that came during half-time and has stayed with me ever since. 
Fast-forward to 2018 and I can see that  America is learning to play football. 

We see the new clubs to the MLS with team names like Atlanta United Football Club, Minnesota United Football Club, 
or the latest being Inter Miami which is Club International de futbol. This quote alone is what sparked my interest 
in how the NFL & Soccer subreddits use the word football.  Will the real football please stand up!?

What can we learn about these people based from their posts in these subreddits? Well, we’ve found a few. 
We were able to learn which group is has more positive posts by generating scores based on the language, punctuations, 
and emoticons. We found some of the political issues that are currently affecting the sport. We were also able to identify 
any misclassifications and why were they misclassified. 

This was the first attempt at understanding how the word football may evolve or may not in the future. 
Now, more than ever, do I want to really prove if America is really learning how to play two different football games. 
Let’s see If my middle school soccer coach knew what the hell he was talking about.
